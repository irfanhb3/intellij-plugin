# intellij-plugin
This is a simple plugin to move jira issues from android studio.
Learning to create some simple IntelliJ plugin based on the droidcon talk given by Marcos Holgado.
This project follows a MVP pattern and uses 
-> Dagger for dependency injection
-> Retrofit for Network calls
-> RxJava for callbacks.
